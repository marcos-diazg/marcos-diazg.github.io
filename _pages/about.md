I am a __Junior Group Leader__ at the __Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO)__. In the newly formed Digital Genomics lab we are in the pursuit of understanding better the mechanisms behind the accumulation of genomic alterations in human tumors to benefit cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection.

By developing new computational methodologies based on artificial intelligence (AI), we can identify the underlying mechanisms of cancer predisposition and progression based on specific signatures of somatic mutations. We have an interest in applying these innovative methods to diverse cohorts of cancer patients to advance our understanding of the dynamics and evolution of tumors in different populations across the world.
