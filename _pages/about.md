I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Prof. Ludmil B. Alexandrov at UC San Diego. Originally trained in engineering, I have focused my career on computational biology, with a strong interest in cancer genomics data analysis.

My research focuses on developing new computational methodologies that allow the discovery of the underlying mechanisms of cancer predisposition and progression based on specific signatures of somatic mutations. I have an interest in applying these innovative methods to diverse cohorts of cancer patients to better understand the dynamics and evolution of tumors worldwide and to comprehensively characterize the processes leading to tumorigenesis in different populations.
