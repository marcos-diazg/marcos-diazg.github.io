I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Dr. Ludmil B. Alexandrov at the University of California, San Diego. Originally trained in engineering, I have focused my career on biomedical research, with a strong interest in computational biology, particularly cancer genomic data analysis. I have become fascinated by the development of new computational methodologies in cancer research allowing the discovery of the underlying mechanisms of cancer predisposition and progression. Making this knowledge accessible to the research community and understanding the dynamics of human cancer are my main goals at the Alexandrov lab.
