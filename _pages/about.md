I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Prof. [Ludmil B. Alexandrov](http://alexandrov.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego.

Originally trained in engineering, I have focused my career on computational biology, with a strong interest in cancer genomic data analysis. My research focuses on the development of new computational methodologies that allow the discovery of the underlying mechanisms of cancer predisposition and progression. Making this knowledge accessible to the research community and understanding the dynamics and evolution of human cancer are my main goals at the Alexandrov lab.
